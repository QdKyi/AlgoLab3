## Algorithm Description
My function takes number of pairs and list of this pairs,
(sorting pair list before processing to the next step)
after this for each of pairs i'm looping through tribes list
and creates new tribe if this pair have none or add this pair
to existing tribe. After this dividing all pairs into tribes
i'm calculating number of female male pairs from different tribes

## Setup
